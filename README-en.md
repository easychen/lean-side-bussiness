This book expands the basic content of "How Programmers Earn Pocket Money Elegantly" and puts it into a larger sideline perspective; at the same time, it introduces the "Lean Entrepreneurship" process that has been verified by the Internet industry, and optimizes it for the sideline-specific "Lean Entrepreneurship" sideline” process.

In the second part of the book, based on actual cases, the content of "independent development and monetization" and "online course monetization practice" was added.

This book was completed in December 2020, later than[One Person Company Methodology](https://github.com/easychen/one-person-businesses-methodology)，After reading this book, you can read[One Person Company Methodology](https://github.com/easychen/one-person-businesses-methodology). If there is an opportunity in the future, I will try to integrate the "lean sideline" and "one-person company methodology" into one system.
